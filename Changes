Revision history for PDL-IO-Nifti

0.52	10. 5. 2013

        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

0.60    4. 9. 2013

	* 	important bug fixes

0.70	30. 10. 2013

	*	Nifti now uses PDL as base class, making use of the PDL hash
		key for the data! This means that any Nifti object is also a
		piddle, this could break code!  

	*	for typemapping, I used get_datatype, but since the numbers seem
		to be rather arbitray, this was changed to using type().
